# ReactJS Redux-Saga Advanced - Day 1

## Overview

In the first day of this course, students review Redux-Saga concepts most relevant to practices found in React applications. Students then learn what Redux-Saga is, and why it is useful. 

## Learning Objectives

* Utilize JavaScript Generators to manage Asynchronous Code 
* Employ the Redux Saga library to manage Asynchronous Code for React/Redux 
Applications
* Manage Asynchronous Operations in Sequence and in Parallel and Compose 
Sagas 
* Handle Errors with Redux Saga

## Suggested Pacing

This is a *rough* estimation on how long to spend on topics, but will be adjusted to the needs of the classroom!
