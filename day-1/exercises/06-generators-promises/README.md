# ES2018, Generators and Promises

# Exercise 1 - Async Iteration

Create an asynchronous iterable that yields the numbers 1 through 5 with a delay of 1 second between each number

---

# Exercise 2 - Async Iteration

Expand on the previous exercise. Create an asynchronous iterable that fetches data from the JSONPlaceholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) and yields each post one at a time

---

# Exercise 3 - Generators and Promises

Create a generator function that yields promises. The promises should resolve to the numbers 1, 2, and 3 with a delay of 1 second between each number

---

# Exercise 4 - Generators and Promises

Expand on the previous exercise. Create a generator function that yields promises, where each promise fetches a post from the JSONPlaceholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/{id}) and resolves to the post data

---

# Exercise 4 - Generators and Promises

Create a generator function that yields promises, where each promise fetches a post from the JSONPlaceholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/{id}) and resolves to the post data. Then, create a second generator function that accepts a generator as a parameter and iterates through its yielded promises, printing each post to the console
